### Premise

The goal of this assignment was to develop a **health incentive program** for the fictional country of Lumaria. We were given AI generated life insurance data, some health program interventions and general economic/encyclopedic data on the fictional country. We were tasked with creating a program with the focus on reducing mortality, and generating profits for the company and discounts for policyholders.

### R Code

The provided R Code utilises the crude mortality rates to calculate the expected value of a policy before and after the mortality adjustments. It utilises parallel programming to speed up the calculations and commonly used packages like _dplyr_ and _ggplot2_ to perform data wrangling and exploratory data analysis.
